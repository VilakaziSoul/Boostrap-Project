# Boostrap-Project

# Hi!! My name is Kathide Vilakazi and I am currently learning how to code in HTML and use Bootstrap.
This project is a simple e-commerce-like webpage showcasing various tech products along with their prices and images. Users can explore the products and submit inquiries through the contact form. 

Open the index.html file in a web browser to view the webpage.
Explore the products and hover over them for image hover effects. 
Fill out the contact form at the bottom to submit inquiries. (Not currently coded)
